# nba_golden_game

I define a Golden Game in the NBA to be a game in which a player scores the same number of points as his jersey number.

In this project, I'll look at players who have achieved this feat over the last 30 years.

Base NBA statistical data downloaded directly from the [official NBA stats site](https://www.nba.com/stats/)

Player numbers scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) in [playerno_scrape.py](https://github.com/warthandrew/nba_golden_game/blob/master/playerno_scrape.py),
with output stored in player_nos.csv.

Analysis and visualization done in [analyze_golden_games.ipynb](https://github.com/warthandrew/nba_golden_game/blob/master/analyze_golden_games.ipynb)
